# Elsepin changelog

Updated through **8 November 2026** (America/Los_Angeles). Elsepin 2.6.0 (59)
is the official release. Earlier Shift entries retain their original names and release status.

[App introduction](README.md) · [Build history](docs/BUILD-HISTORY.md) · [Detailed Change Ledger](docs/CHANGE-LEDGER.md)

## Build 76 - Dev Mode, sweep selection and map hardening (8 November 2026)

Private build validation pending. Owner reports build 75 still exits on satellite
zoom and sometimes saving/zooming around a pin; no new incident export is present
in Downloads. Owner currently reports no noticeable heat. These are device reports,
not a confirmed crash cause or a measured energy result. No release is authorized.

- Advanced & experimental -> Testing tools has Dev Mode. Demo library and ordinary
  preferences use a separate defaults domain/file directory. Original library files
  are never replaced. Stop/finish the session and recovery before switching; pending
  saves finish first. Recreate drafts, reject stale library/import callbacks, refresh
  widget snapshots, and reset demo edits on the next activation. Pairing, connected
  accounts, security/icon settings, clear-state evidence and diagnostics stay global.
- Fixtures include eight pins, six walk/run/cycle/e-bike/drive/mixed routes, second
  and two-hour waits, folders, two areas, route history/recents and ten deleted items.
  Synthetic paths are not verified roads. Real connection, cloud helper/signing
  requirements and explicit Start/Teleport confirmation still apply.
- Recently Deleted: drag the selection-circle gutter to select/deselect a contiguous
  range, including fast/reversed gestures. Scroll normally elsewhere. Preserve
  individual taps, accessibility actions, cancellation cleanup and deletion review.
- Save a pin's full metadata with one publication/write. Delay native tap-coordinate
  projection until a tap succeeds (not the first finger of a pinch). Pause covered
  map callbacks and filter pin-editor annotations by the viewport. These remove
  concrete churn/hazards but do not establish that the reported crash is resolved.
- Opt-in diagnostics add current/peak memory footprint and advisory memory headroom;
  map snapshots are rate limited to five seconds. No new polling loop. Numeric touch
  formatting rejects nonfinite/out-of-range inputs instead of trapping.

Local evidence: 17 packaging/resource tests, identity/appearance/helper checks and
Swift syntax parsing passed. New Swift tests cover workspace separation/relaunch,
failed seeds, demo fixture round-trips, drag ranges and diagnostic values. Native
compilation, Swift test execution and real-device acceptance are still pending.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 75 (7 November 2026)

- Clarify that naming a start/stop/destination labels that route and does not
  create a saved pin. Keep search bars inside their own editors to prevent a
  leftover search control over the route planner.
- Retain prepared routes until the first confirmed write; return to the preview
  after a definite no-write start failure. Preserve connection/clear warnings
  when a previous or uncertain location may remain.
- Keep smoothing specific to each active route, including recovery, saved
  routes and recalculation. Label the active-route switch "This route only."
- Harden native pin gestures and invalid map-camera/overlay inputs; add bounded
  local map/start diagnostic events. Reported zoom-out crashes still need native
  investigation and a fresh phone retest before being considered resolved.
- Add Favorite/Unfavorite and confirmed Delete swipes to pins/routes, and
  Restore/Delete in Recently Deleted. Keep active-route and trash protections.
- Replace import paragraphs with grouped selected additions and exact setting
  changes. Fix garbled separators and legacy surface comparisons; retain old
  backup compatibility and prevent unchanged values appearing as new changes.
- Private build 75 passed 640 checks, native app/extension compilation and IPA
  inspection with zero compiler warnings/errors. Delivered to the Desktop project
  IPA folder, replacing 74. First-build callback warning was fixed and rebuilt.
  Zoom-crash and gesture acceptance still need a phone check. No public release.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 74 (6 November 2026)

- Offer Keep current path or Recalculate when changing between route networks.
- Remove redundant Whole route/Individual leg settings controls, Route notes and
  Edit names & places. Use plain leg controls; consolidate expanded Options.
- Put arrival behavior at Destination and naming in endpoint/stop menus, including
  Name route at Start. Keep Move places on map.
- Restore native back swipes in pushed editors. Expand Add Stop's map with search,
  result selection and custom pins; confirm before adding. Exact-path pauses stay
  on their path. Remove collapse arrow when the tray only shows idle guidance.
- Compatibility, explicit movement confirmation and recovery remain unchanged.
  Private build `b66aad4` passed 634 checks and native app/extension compilation,
  zero compiler warnings/errors. Delivered build 74 to the Desktop project IPA
  folder, replacing 73. Phone gesture/layout acceptance remains; no public release.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 73 (6 November 2026)

- Tap the movement row between stops to change only that leg's mode and speed.
  Saved and custom paths support this too. Speed-only edits reuse their path;
  automatic routes recalculate when a different road/path network is needed.
- A ready route ignores map pin taps until you close it with X. Planned routes
  now appear in Recents before starting; tapping a recent route opens the planner.
- Smaller map tray with inline shortcuts; remove its duplicate Settings and More
  controls. Main Settings, explicit Start/Stop, collapse and touch targets remain.
- Simplify planning into Stops, Whole route, Summary and one indented Options
  group. Remove redundant timing paragraphs; retain stops, arrival behavior,
  rehearsal, route warnings, drawing, GPX and saving.
- Clarify Hybrid as Satellite + labels. Satellite remains imagery-only; old
  map-style settings and backups keep their meaning. Old tray Settings choices
  import successfully without restoring the removed button.
- Cache the planner preview path and honor iOS 27's reduced-resource hint for
  optional camera refresh/loading motion. Movement timing and Stop are unchanged.
- Private build passed at `567e6c5`: 631 automated checks, native app/extension,
  zero compiler warnings/errors, both bundles 2.6.1 (73). Delivered the IPA to
  the Desktop project IPA folder, replacing build 72. No public release; device
  UI and battery benefit are not established by compilation.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 72 (5 November 2026)

- Reopen the developer service for explicit movement and Stop instead of trusting
  a cached handle after VPN changes. Missing-endpoint checks wait at most 750 ms;
  continuous playback keeps its existing cadence and connection.
- Mark a potentially simulated location only immediately before a native write.
  Canceling a first connection check no longer creates a false unfinished session.
  An actual attempted write still requires an accepted clear; app exit is not proof.
  Recovery state is acknowledged on disk before movement, preserving it even if
  the process exits before asynchronous preferences finish saving.
- Defer route endpoint/stop edits until search navigation returns. Freeze the search
  route and the timeline's previous-row data during transitions. Add a directions
  timeout and clearer disabled-preview guidance for unavailable cycling paths.
- Label Live Activity age as "Sent" and hide that timer in unverified states.
  The timer ages the last sent update; it is not a periodic background connection test.
- Extend the local developer log with route/network stages and durations, screen,
  current/peak memory, CPU/context switches, and complete bounded iOS diagnostic
  reports when MetricKit supplies them. Routine observations batch; failures and
  route handoffs flush promptly. No telemetry upload or credentials are included.
- Build-71 feedback confirms search results arrived before the reported Add Stop
  exit. No OS crash stack was in that export; the exact crash cause and new device
  behavior require retesting.
- Private native validation passed at `50467da`: 620 automated checks, app and
  extension compilation, zero compiler warnings/errors and IPA verification.
  Delivered build 72 to the Desktop project IPA folder, replacing build 71.
  Physical route/VPN behavior and heat remain device-retest items. No publication.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 71 (5 November 2026)

- Check the actual developer TCP endpoint before explicit location commands and
  Stop; reject an unreachable endpoint before writing. Continuous movement reuses
  the check for at most ten seconds. This is connection evidence, not verification
  of Find My/Life360. Keep failed clear operations honest and retryable.
- Correct garbled Stop/icon text and add a prebuild encoding regression check.
  Show connecting/stopping/failed states instead of premature "Holding location."
- Tap a saved map pin to select it for an explicit teleport. Enlarge saved pins by
  default, with a 22–64 point Appearance slider and backward-compatible selective backups.
- Star pins/routes immediately without a naming dialog. Unnamed pins use "Unnamed pin";
  naming and favoriting stay separate. Retain existing names, folders, symbols and colors.
- Compact map actions and Recently Deleted selection controls; retain touch targets,
  accessibility layouts, restore and permanent-delete confirmation.
- Add local CPU/peak-memory/thermal/work-state diagnostics and a "Phone feels warm"
  log marker. Sample only while foregrounded and recording; stop failed-session
  monitors, end precise fixes when sufficient, and release failed pairing audio.
- Capture iOS icon error codes, check installed icon metadata and let successful
  icon transitions settle. Clarify missing widget shared-storage signing access
  and disable unavailable saved-shortcut controls. Signer/device acceptance is pending.
- Native app/extension and IPA validation passed at `14d2050`: 615 automated
  checks, zero compiler warnings/errors; one Windows-only test skipped on Mac.
  Privately delivered build 71. Phone/signing/heat acceptance remains pending.
  No release, deployment, or paid billing.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 70 (5 November 2026)

- Show saved area outlines on the main map. The existing layers button now opens
  Map options with independent Pins/Areas toggles and Standard/Hybrid/Satellite choices.
- Remember layer visibility and include it in selective settings backup import/export;
  old backups preserve current layer choices. Hiding a layer never deletes it,
  changes area naming, hides the active route or sends a location.
- Cache pin filtering between camera/library changes and reuse area polygon geometry
  between library edits. No movement, connection-check or recovery cadence changes.
- Move private IPA delivery to the owner's Desktop project IPA folder, with one latest
  Elsepin IPA and no extra delivered files. Native validation passed; no publication.
- After the GitHub suspension, resume authorized private hosting on GitLab in the
  existing local folder. Reuse the manual Codemagic personal M2 workflow with a
  dedicated read-only repository key; no paid billing, release or deployment.
- Native app/extension and IPA inspection passed at `0e098f2`, with 611 distinct
  tests and zero compiler warnings/errors. Build 70 privately replaced build 69
  in the Desktop project IPA folder. Device acceptance and measured energy remain pending.

## Unreleased — 2.6.1 build 69 (4 November 2026)

- Separate named Pins from Favorites; favorites now group Pins and Routes. Name a pin without starring it, edit it on its own Library screen, and optionally favorite saved routes.
- Show saved pin symbols on the main map; tap for a small name label. Keep movement confirmation separate.
- Add area-editor search below the drawing instructions, preserving the outline while moving the camera.
- Add recent-route history and separate pin/route actions. Naming saves to Library; history privacy controls cover both kinds.
- Remove the Home search Saved places section, shorten the dropped-pin label, and improve general/category search with bounded waits, cancellation and a nearby fallback.
- Search along an active route to browse/save places without redirecting it. Draft stop search retains route preview and shows partial results sooner.
- Ask before using a walking path when a cycling/e-bike route is unavailable.
- Reduce stop-wait wakeups and throttle camera following during thermal pressure without slowing simulated travel or changing connection checks.
- Preserve legacy backup import, saved pin favorites, routes, areas, themes, icons, manual movement and recovery safeguards.
- Add a manual private Codemagic Mac build alternative, preserving tests, complete logs and failure status; no automatic release or paid subscription.
- Correct the library-only backup test fixture, remove a test cleanup concurrency warning, and fix the native MapKit fallback error-code conversion.
- Native app/extension compilation and IPA validation passed in Codemagic at
  `8b155ec`, with zero compiler warnings/errors and 609 distinct tests passed
  across Mac and Windows checks. Build 69 was originally delivered in Downloads
  and re-delivered to the Desktop project IPA folder on 5 November.
  Device acceptance is pending; no release or deployment.

## 2.6.1 (68) — compact route card and automatic trip recovery — private test build

- Collapse/expand the active-route card while retaining progress, remaining distance,
  Pause/Resume, Stop and actionable warnings. New routes open expanded.
- Restore an interrupted route and its saved position on launch. A remembered running
  trip saved within 24 hours gets one reconnect attempt in an unlocked foreground,
  once Wi-Fi and pairing are available. LocalDevVPN must work. Travel resumes only
  after the saved point is accepted; downtime is not added to distance or stop waits.
- Paused trips, legacy checkpoints without recorded intent, older checkpoints and
  failed reconnects require manual Resume/Retry. Stop/End route, discard and disabling
  recovery revoke automatic intent. No background polling/reconnect loop was added.
- On a delivered UIKit termination callback, preserve the checkpoint, cancel process
  workers, close the engine command gate and attempt a clear on the existing serial
  connection. Normal backgrounding remains unchanged. iOS can terminate without
  this callback; clearing/activity removal cannot be guaranteed after force-kill.
- Show saved/reconnecting state without claiming active spoofing. Preserve genuine
  errors and explicit clearing when the device state remains unknown. A successful
  clear alone, or proof no location was sent, clears the legacy unfinished marker.
- Preserve compatibility IDs, backup formats, themes and bundled helper exports.
  Build 67 is retained. No public release, deployment or public asset changes.
- Native run 41526208045, attempt 3, passed all 600 tests (461 Swift, 104 cloud,
  19 Companion, 16 packaging/icon), app/extension compilation and IPA verification,
  with zero compiler warnings/errors. The private build 68 IPA is hash-verified in
  Downloads. Earlier runner-allocation failures remain recorded in CURRENT-WORK.
  Physical-phone acceptance remains pending; the release stays unpublished.

## 2.6.1 (67) — native request progress — unpublished

- Add native 20-point Thinking Orbs beside existing place search, route-stop search
  and explicit cloud Test connection labels. Indicators follow existing requests;
  cancellation, errors, results and manual movement controls are unchanged.
- Keep progress static for Reduce Motion, Low Power Mode, inactive scenes and
  disappeared views. Labels remain readable and announced once by VoiceOver;
  existing typography, themes and accessibility text sizing are retained.
- Pin the reviewed MIT-licensed ThinkingOrbsKit revision to the app target only;
  retain its notice. No web bridge, AI service, new permissions or polling.
- Include the separately reviewed removal of 264 unused production Swift lines.
  Existing tests were retained; four motion-policy regression tests were added.
- Native run 41518500417 passed 586 tests, app/extension compilation and IPA
  validation with zero compiler warnings/errors. Build 67 is verified in Downloads.
  No public release or website deployment.

## Local cleanup after build 66 — 2 November 2026 — not built or published

- Remove unreachable old pin/easter-egg views, unused Settings components, a redundant
  named-area screen wrapper and unused getters/helpers. Current UI, data formats,
  movement confirmation, security, accessibility and OS support are unchanged.
- Remove 264 production Swift lines plus eight stale project references; no tests removed.
- 443 Swift and 16 packaging tests pass; identity, appearance, helper archives and changed
  source syntax checks pass. Native Xcode validation is pending permitted source upload.
- Preserve build 66 artifacts. New skills/orb dependency remain uninstalled pending approval.

## 2.6.1 (66) — incident export and experimental helper fixes — unpublished

- Export retained events around a marked problem from the existing Session timeline:
  up to five minutes before/after, associated notes, bounded streaming and explicit
  missing/truncated-data metadata. Full export, opt-in recording and retention stay intact.
- Link route hold/drag, manual jump/Undo/retry, queued writes and outcomes by attempt.
  Record rejection/interruption without changing gesture, movement or confirmation rules.
- Share recent provider reads between Nearby and spoof-checks without refreshing old
  timestamps. Update sign-in/blocked readiness for Nearby-only failures; retain login
  across transient timeouts and keep providers independent.
- Package the Python runtime pin and correct setup instructions in the exported helpers.
  Add an experimental/download audit and a complete ordered owner test walkthrough.
- Portable validation: 443 Swift tests, 104 cloud, 19 companion and 16 packaging/icon
  checks (582 total). Native run `41396515177` passed compilation, signing and
  packaging with zero compiler warnings/errors. Both helpers also pass tests from
  freshly extracted ZIPs. Build 66 is hash-verified in Downloads with the 216-step
  checklist and test pack; real provider login, push delivery and phone gestures
  require owner acceptance.
- No public release, helper deployment or website update.

## 2.6.1 (65) — native warning cleanup — 31 October 2026

- Replace deprecated certificate access in the Windows companion and self-hosted
  cloud helper delegates with `SecTrustCopyCertificateChain(...).first`. Retain
  leaf SHA-256 pinning, host checks, rejected redirects and managed-HTTPS system
  trust handling. No broader trust exception or credential change.
- Mark the MainActor-created location manager's legacy delegate conformance with
  checked `@preconcurrency`. Core Location delivers on its creation run loop;
  preserve synchronous fresh-fix handling, cancellation and foreground-only checks.
- Increment both target build numbers to 65 so native validation is distinguishable
  from the user's ongoing build 64 route-crash test. UI and route code are unchanged.
- Native run 41213887689 passed 565 tests and app/extension compilation with
  zero compiler warnings/errors. The private IPA artifact passed integrity,
  identity, icon/resource and hash checks. Build 64 in Downloads is unchanged;
  no new Downloads/Drive delivery or release publication. Device checks remain pending.

## 2.6.1 (64) — route interaction and stop discovery — 30 October 2026

- Replace route-marker touch callbacks' SwiftUI map conversions with native
  MapKit projection. Keep a weak map reference for marker drags; discard stale
  marker state on disconnection/retry, backgrounding or route replacement.
  Hold/drag remains preview-only; Teleport is still an explicit confirmation.
- User-confirmed in build 63: keyboard Search works; route holding still exits
  the app. A supplied optional developer log records successful location writes,
  then `route_marker_hold_began`, followed by a new process. No jump was recorded.
  This identifies the interaction boundary, not the exact iOS exception or a
  verified fix. The supplied log does not include a retry attempt.
- Add draft-stop search with Along route/Everywhere scopes, route/result map,
  Coffee/Food/Groceries/Parks shortcuts, saved/recent places, addresses and
  distance from the path. Filter and deduplicate actual coordinates; order
  along-route matches and insert the chosen stop into the existing itinerary.
  Rebuild the preview without starting movement. Live-path pause stops retain
  their existing behavior; use Hold location and edit for a new destination detour.
- Bound explicit MapKit searches to four cancellable requests; reject stale
  results and disclose incomplete/long-route sampling. Distance from the path
  is not a claimed detour time. No Google dependency, key or background polling.
- Indent expanded Advanced/More options and give advanced child rows a subtle
  theme-colored rail. Keep native controls, accessibility and all existing options.
- Five portable corridor tests cover bent routes, invalid coordinates, bounded
  regions, long routes, date-line geometry, stop insertion and deduplication.
  Native validation passed: 565 tests, app/extension compilation and verified
  Downloads delivery in run 41176847512. Three existing warnings remain;
  phone acceptance is pending. Release remains unpublished.

## 2.6.1 (63) — route/search follow-up — 30 October 2026

- Keyboard Search and the general-search button now show matching places with
  addresses. They do not silently choose the first result or open its action
  dialog. Preserve autocomplete, favorites, cancellation and manual movement confirmation.
- Harden route holds against stale route indexes and event-converter lifetime;
  read the native map's touch coordinates and avoid reconfiguring its gestures
  during a hold. Clear dragging state after backgrounding or leaving the map.
- Calculate simulated route time with the playback acceleration/corner rules
  when Smooth movement is enabled, including section speeds and stop waits.
  Cache estimates; show Apple Maps' separate travel estimate where available.
- Pace route updates from successful confirmations as well as dispatch time.
  Account conservatively for recent write latency and prevent a slow update
  followed by an immediate catch-up burst. Reset timing after jumps/resumes.
  This improves coordinate timing; it cannot set or guarantee Life360's MPH.
- Fit route name, remaining distance, ETA and progress into a shorter activity.
  Keep update status, stale/error warnings and optional Find My/Life360 checks;
  bound timer width and remove redundant command-age text.
- Nine new timing/pacing regression tests cover this work. Final native run
  `41174566247` passed all 560 tests plus compilation/package validation and the
  verified IPA is in Downloads. Three existing warnings remain. Phone retests
  are pending. These are fixes/hardening for reported full app exits; no crash
  report was available, so the exact termination causes are not confirmed.
  The Irvine trip's exact MapKit results and real travel time are unverified.
- Preserve appearance defaults, pairing PIN handling, identifiers, backup formats
  and explicit confirmation before a route jump. No public release.
- Native attempt `41173992580` passed 557 tests but failed on a Swift map-view
  type-check complexity error. Extracted search-dismissal handling into its
  own method; the subsequent build must validate that correction and pacing.

## 2.6.1 (62) — private UI test build — 30 October 2026

Delivered privately to Downloads. [Native run 41126221099](https://github.com/N3moStudio/Elsepin/actions/runs/41126221099)
passed at source `a213d8b37a87759b0db719a9caa2ba571427330e`: 422 Swift, 14 packaging/icon,
19 Companion and 96 cloud tests (551 total), native app/extension compilation and
signature/package checks. Both bundles are 2.6.1 (62), SDK 27.1. Download integrity,
thirteen icons and SHA-256 were verified. Three pre-existing certificate/delegate
warnings remain; no new UI diagnostics. The release remains an unpublished draft.

- Give the on-device pairing sheet three connected steps in task order and shorter
  introductory text. Remove the Pairing help section per the preview feedback.
  Preserve the real code/status display and native pairing lifecycle.
- Use the selected theme behind the pairing sheet and the existing themed button
  style for its primary actions, including existing Reduce Motion behavior.
- Show all five draft route modes in a wrapping grid; use a single flexible column
  for accessibility text sizes. Keep mode selection and speed behavior unchanged.
- Preserve Bloom/Solid defaults, compact rounded text, the larger Settings identity
  card, all themes/icons and backup compatibility. The preceding 57 focused tests
  and syntax checks passed; native compilation has now passed. Device checks remain pending.

## 2.6.1 (61) — unreleased follow-up — 29–30 October 2026

- 30 October private test build: native run `41103527856` passed at source `e7065f2`, with 551 tests (422 Swift, 14 packaging/icon, 19 Companion, 96 cloud). Both bundles are 2.6.1 (61), SDK 27.1; the IPA passed package checks and matched GitHub SHA-256 `59031619b950c09b915b9b70ca7a29501dbef3cf2df321356f7098740fe91cbc`. Saved as `Elsepin 2.6.1 build 61.ipa` in Downloads. Three existing trust/delegate compiler warnings remain recorded in the build history. Release is still an unpublished draft; real-device acceptance is pending.
- Show on-device pairing progress and the generated six-digit code in the existing Live Activity, including the expanded Dynamic Island. Start before leaving Elsepin for iPhone Settings; retain notification and in-app fallbacks. Respect the Live Activities preference and system authorization.
- Clear pairing presentation on success/failure/cancel, reject late callbacks from cancelled attempts, and bound code visibility to five minutes after the latest pairing event. Codes stay out of logs/backups and are privacy-sensitive/stale-aware. This display deadline does not change the native protocol's validity.
- Pairing follow-up: all 422 portable Swift tests passed, including eight new code, expiry, compatibility and activity-ownership tests. Changed native sources passed syntax parsing only; native compilation, background pairing and Island presentation remain pending. No IPA or publication.
- Keep Settings compact while retaining the larger “MAKE IT YOURS / Your space. Your way.” card, icon and current theme/surface subtitle. Remove only the duplicate Appearance row; keep Appearance searchable and preserve all settings destinations.
- Move the two-choice surface picker above the theme list, retaining all eight themes and thirteen icons.
- Open the optional json.site helper inside an iOS Safari sheet. Done returns to import; file selection, copy, Paste and import confirmation remain explicit. No JavaScript bridge, automatic backup upload or clipboard reads.
- Align import/export actions with Settings icon rows; move concise JSON instructions into the section footer.
- 30 October checks: 60 focused Swift import/backup/appearance/search tests passed, plus syntax parsing of changed UI sources. This is not iOS SDK type-checking or device acceptance.


- Keep Settings search in the native swipe-revealed drawer; use a compact navigation title and 16-point content-top spacing to address the reported crowding between search and the first card. Device scroll/layout acceptance remains pending.
- Simplify Surfaces to Solid first and Liquid Glass second. New/reset preferences use Solid. Remove Theme default and its reset button; old `theme` values decode as Solid without changing explicit Glass choices.
- Verify old-backup import/re-export and surface persistence: 414 Swift tests and 14 Python script tests passed. No new native build, IPA, release or deployment for build 61. The delivered build 60 does not contain this follow-up.

## 2.6.1 (60) — private test build — 28 October 2026

- Default to Bloom; remove Abyss with a compatibility mapping to Bloom for existing settings and backups.
- Fix typography to rounded/compact while respecting accessibility sizes. Remove font, text-size and color-mode controls; retain theme and surface selection and all thirteen icons.
- Preserve backup schema and old-file decoding, hide retired controls in import review, and export compatible fixed typography values.
- Refresh website catalog source; not deployed. No paid feature gates added.
- Verified 410 portable Swift tests, 14 Python tests, appearance/identity/helper checks and static website generation. Native app/extension build and IPA validation subsequently passed in run `40826806154`; test IPA delivered privately. Device acceptance pending; release remains unpublished.
- See [draft release notes](docs/releases/2.6.1-DRAFT.md).

## 2.6.0 (59) — official — 27 October 2026

- Publish the exact IPA from successful Mac run `40460137350`, source `304756f035172d6e8e3406a451ee57c25cd07951`, after package inspection and matching the GitHub artifact digest. SHA-256: `c8cb9197d1b856bcd90a9de7d29311f82411eddd7b825a5d32a2080747156d22`. Earlier no-IPA statements below describe their original development checkpoints.

- Rebrand the regular app, setup/pairing prompts, notifications, Live Activities, helper downloads and backup filenames to Elsepin. Use Prism Jumpgate as the primary icon; retain all thirteen icon options and nine themes.
- Give Ion its dark olive canvas, solid panels and citron actions. Apply theme defaults for color mode, surfaces, font design and relative text size, with independent persistent overrides and a reset-to-theme control. Keep accessibility text sizes and Reduce Transparency respected.
- Replace translucent app-owned navigation/control surfaces when Solid is selected; keep one map and session alive during appearance changes. System-owned menus retain system behavior.
- Refresh Settings with an appearance card and clearer groups. Add Software updates and a manual stable-release check with progress, empty/error feedback, cancellation guards and server-requested cooldowns. Automatic checks remain foreground-only and once daily.
- Back up/review/import the new appearance settings individually, preserving older library files. Preserve existing bundle IDs, defaults, keychain services and widget links to protect upgrades.
- Add a responsive static website with nine interactive theme previews, thirteen icon choices, setup/privacy pages and no tracking or keep-alive requirement. Build assets from an explicit allowlist and reject stale unexpected output.
- Establish private Elsepin development and a public Elsepin-Releases download/help endpoint. Preserve inherited notices and accurately scope restrictions to identified new original files. Catalog dependencies and compatibility traps in the Product Atlas.
- Branding follow-up: remove the old product name from the incomplete-backup message and exported diagnostic-log description. Keep old backup formats, storage keys and notification IDs compatible. The public update endpoint returns no official release until one is published. Follow-up validation: 32 backup-import and diagnostic-log tests passed on WSL; no native rebuild or IPA. The first test invocation had a shell-quoting error; rerunning the existing compiled tests with direct argument passing passed.
- Validation: [private Mac run 40442493014](https://github.com/N3moStudio/Elsepin/actions/runs/40442493014) passed 533 automated tests (404 shared Swift, 14 packaging/icon, 19 Windows-helper, 96 cloud-helper) and native app/extension compilation at b5f5b24. Website phone-frame checks at 320/375/430/768 pixels showed no horizontal overflow; all preview images loaded. The static website is live at https://elsepin.onrender.com. Device appearance, provider, battery and accessibility acceptance remain pending. No new IPA or GitHub release.


### Documentation, workflow and build-record follow-up — 26 October 2026

- Refine the public README to a visual route banner, short feature list and prominent website/release links. Remove the development notice and long explanations; preserve the full changelog, build records and guides. No release is created by this presentation change.

- Refresh the public README with the app introduction, Prism Jumpgate artwork, feature groups, all nine themes/thirteen icons, setup, honest release status, optional-provider limits and support links.
- Preserve the entire earlier changelog and publish a synchronized public copy plus a build register. Record the two failed Elsepin attempts and their fixes, rather than reporting only the successful run.
- Run `40441280998` (`a863660`) failed during appearance initialization; `ea91bd2` fixes initialization ordering. Run `40441622492` then failed the icon-resource check because XcodeGen uses grouped paths; `b5f5b24` fixes that validation. Run `40442493014` passed 533 tests and native app/extension compilation. No IPA was packaged by any of these three runs.
- Simplify the manual workflow to **Build Elsepin IPA**: remove the packaging checkbox and validation-only artifact; keep automatic tests, identity/resource checks and one downloadable IPA for future runs. Update the maintainer build guide.
- Retain private application development and public downloads/help. This documentation/workflow update creates no IPA, tag or release and does not change app behavior. Previous successful native validation applies to its recorded source, not to an unrun future workflow.


## 2.5.8 (58) — official — 26 October 2026

- Publish the exact release-candidate IPA after the maintainer's successful iPhone test and explicit approval; no application code or binary changes during promotion.
- Include all six additional themes, four icons, map/control-tray/joystick improvements, cloud helper UI and experimental Nearby alerts, scoped resets and Recently Deleted bulk selection. Preserve the full library, routes/driving, import/export, existing themes/icons and manual widget confirmation.
- Update the README, release/build guidance and Shift Change Ledger. Publish `v2.5.8` as official Latest with comprehensive notes and the verified IPA; merge the tested source into main.
- Validation: 526 automated tests, native app/extension build and package inspection passed. The released IPA is 2.5.8 (58), stable channel, SHA-256 `62e73269cccfcaf0da9bfa855768038f75145ae9b060ff9860ee58a916e62a08`. Find My People remains unsupported; provider/battery/accessibility coverage is not inferred from the maintainer's general acceptance.

## 2.5.8 (58) — release candidate — 26 October 2026

- Package the full 2.5.8 development work and the additional themes/icons for the requested iPhone test. Build both targets as 58 with stable update-channel metadata so the exact tested artifact can become official after acceptance.
- Include all six additional light/dark themes, four optional icons, the compact cloud/Nearby setup and website, opt-in place alerts, interruption-safe tray/joystick behavior, reset options and Recently Deleted bulk selection described below.
- Draft the complete release notes while native CI runs. Keep the public release unpublished until the maintainer reports successful device testing; no helper deployment is part of this build.
- Validation: [Mac run 40414605689](https://github.com/N3moStudio/Shift/actions/runs/40414605689) passed all 526 tests, native app/extension compilation and IPA packaging in 4m 9s. The downloaded build-58 IPA passed independent integrity/identity/resource checks and matches the Actions checksum. Exact evidence is in the Shift Change Ledger. Find My People remains unavailable; real provider and physical-device acceptance are pending.

## Unreleased — additional themes and icons — 26 October 2026

- Add Ion, Ember, Abyss, Bloom, Blueprint and Titanium to Settings → Appearance, each with light and dark palettes. Keep Glacier, Afterhours, Porcelain, the existing selection and independent icon preferences.
- Add Ion Jumpgate, Titanium Jumpgate, Prism Jumpgate and Ember Switchpath under Choose App Icon → New Icons. Keep all nine original choices and the primary icon; there are now nine themes and thirteen icon choices.
- Carry the new colors and monochrome marks through shared app/widget/Live Activity presentation. Preserve the icon-change lifecycle guard and disable repeated choices while iOS handles a change.
- Add opaque, color-profiled icon exports, Settings thumbnails, approved source/provenance records and matching Xcode/XcodeGen registrations. The four additions use iOS automatic dark/tinted treatment; existing icons retain their supplied variants. Update appearance search terms and compatibility/package checks.
- Validation: 397 Swift logic tests and 14 packaging tests pass locally; palette contrast and all four static icon preflights pass. Native iOS build, Home Screen treatment, icon-switching and device accessibility checks remain pending. No rename, version bump, push, IPA, release or deployment.

## Unreleased — consolidate development on main — 26 October 2026

- Bring the full 2.5.8 development source into `main`: compact cloud/Nearby setup and helper website, opt-in place alerts, map press feedback, interruption-safe tray/joystick controls, reset options and Recently Deleted bulk selection.
- Keep the app as the full Shift edition with its existing names, identity, routes, driving, saved library, import/export and widgets. No branding changes or plan restrictions are part of this merge.
- Point current app/website setup links and hosting instructions to `main`, and regenerate the matching source-only helper archive so deleting the old branches does not break the guide.
- Preserve unfinished Find My People protocol research and unrelated prototypes in verified local recovery snapshots; they are not included in the app or public merge.
- Validation: Mac run [40398031406](https://github.com/N3moStudio/Shift/actions/runs/40398031406) passed all 524 tests and native app/extension compilation on source `6e0244a`; packaging and upload were disabled. Device/provider and battery acceptance remain separate.
- Retire the old development/test branches after verification. Keep version 2.5.8 (57) and the prerelease channel in source; no release, tag, IPA distribution or hosted deployment is created. Published v2.5.7 remains unchanged.

## 2.5.8 (57) — requested test build — 25 October 2026

- Prepare the approved `codex/shift-2.5.8-test` branch and an Actions IPA; no main update, tag, GitHub release or hosted deployment. Both targets use build 57 and the app uses the prerelease channel.
- Add compact cloud settings with connection testing, capability-aware Nearby access and the full setup guide under Advanced. Refresh the helper website with simpler connection cards, a separate place editor, responsive layouts, dark mode and Reduce Motion.
- Add experimental fixed-place enter/leave rules for selected Find My Devices or authorized Life360 Circle members, optional repeated/escalating reminders, explicit Stop this alert, pause/resume, duration limits, encrypted state and opt-in Home Screen Web Push. Find My People remains unavailable. Free hosting can sleep or lose state; real provider/push acceptance remains unverified.
- Include map-button press feedback, interruption-safe tray dragging and joystick release/cancellation, plus the previously validated reset scopes and Recently Deleted bulk selection. Widgets still only prepare a pin and always require manual Start/Teleport.
- Package the matching source-only cloud helper and guide. Mac run 40259930059 passed all 524 tests, compiled the app and extension with Xcode 27.1, and produced the test IPA in 5m 42s. Independently verify build 57, the prerelease channel, icons, helper contents and the downloaded checksum against GitHub. Save the IPA, helper and setup/test checklist to Downloads; exact evidence and remaining device/provider checks are in the Change Ledger.


Dates below use America/Los_Angeles. The [Elsepin Change Ledger](docs/CHANGE-LEDGER.md)
maps each build to its changes, source owners, validation and distribution status.

## Unreleased — lightweight cloud setup and Nearby alerts — 25 October 2026

- Simplify cloud settings to checks, notifications and Advanced; move long setup/troubleshooting explanations to the new GitHub guide. Discover Nearby support before exposing its website link, preserving older helper compatibility.
- Refresh the private helper website with compact connection cards, a separate place editor, contextual notification controls, dark mode, scalable text, immediate press feedback and Reduce Motion support. No frontend framework, animation loop or automatic location permission prompt.
- Add opt-in independent place monitoring for the selected Find My device and authorized members of the connected Life360 Circle. Support circular fixed places, enter/leave events, bounded or until-paused sessions, fresh-report validation, uncertainty margins, two-report crossing confirmation and cancellation guards. Find My People remains unavailable; no research connector is shipped.
- Add once, 5/2/1-minute and escalating Web Push reminders, explicit Stop this alert, Pause rule/all, and separate acknowledgement from opening/dismissing a notification. Add private encrypted rules/subscriptions and restart-paused recovery. Free Render storage/uptime remain limited.
- Add 34 tests (96 cloud tests total). Record Windows/Linux, browser, packaging and source-validation evidence in the Shift Change Ledger. Real provider acceptance, iPhone push receipt and native SwiftUI compilation remain pending. No version bump, deployment, commit, push, release or IPA.

## Unreleased — tray and joystick interruption fixes — 25 October 2026

- Reset a canceled tray drag to its existing open/compact position. Ignore old touch updates after backgrounding, covering the map, or changing layout until that gesture ends. Lock swipe direction at the handle and choose the release position from projected travel, including a last-moment reversal.
- Make the existing 44-point tray handle a button in both positions: tap or use accessibility activation to expand/collapse. Preserve the map viewport and current tray animation timing.
- Stop joystick movement immediately on release or cancellation, before its thumb returns. Disable input when hidden, covered, resized, or inactive; require a fresh touch after an interruption. Prevent an old accessibility nudge or the hidden expanded joystick from stopping newer input. Keep short accessible directional moves and manual Start/Teleport confirmation.
- Follow the finger without inherited animations; return the joystick thumb with no bounce. Reduce Motion snaps the return, and live preference changes safely end held input. Add no polling, display link, background work, or dependencies.
- Validate 395 Swift reliability tests (16 new), Swift syntax parsing, 14 packaging/appearance tests, app identities and icon resources locally. Native iOS compilation, touch event ordering, accessibility and motion feel remain unverified. Update the Shift Change Ledger, source map and motion audit. No version bump, IPA, commit, push or release.

## Unreleased — map button motion pilot — 25 October 2026

- Apply the supplied fluid-motion guide to a focused map-control pilot: immediate touch-down feedback and a short critically damped release on Pause/Resume, interrupted-trip recovery, Teleport/Start, Stop, Start route and Review route. Scope animation to opacity/scale so action execution and label changes do not wait for it.
- Add an opt-in to the existing button style; other screens retain their previous behavior. Keep native Button tracking/cancellation, existing layouts and manual Start/Teleport confirmation. Reduce Motion omits the scale/spring; disabled feedback is immediate. Add no timer, custom gesture, dependency or background work.
- Catalog tray cancellation/reversal, joystick interruptions, native stop sheets, route previews and icon lifecycle in `docs/MOTION-AUDIT.md`, with a before/after recording plan and rollback. Pass 14 existing packaging/appearance tests plus identity/icon-source checks. SwiftUI compilation, real-device feel, live accessibility and frame/battery measurements are NOT RUN on this Windows host. No build/version bump, IPA, remote CI, commit, push or release.

## Unreleased — reset controls and bulk deletion — 25 October 2026

- Add Restore default settings under Settings → Advanced & experimental, keeping saved routes, places, areas, history, pairing and setup.
- Add two reviewed Wipe everything choices: remove local settings/data while keeping device pairing/setup, or also remove the local pairing file and restart setup. Explain what each removes, what stays, and the limits of resetting iOS trust, permissions, external exports and helper-server accounts.
- Require a completely stopped session, no unfinished pairing/check work, and device authentication when app lock is enabled. Block interaction/imports during reset, drain pending recovery/log writes, stop on the first failure, report completed/failed steps, and remove pairing/setup last.
- Add Select, Select All and Deselect All to Recently Deleted across saved places, routes and areas. Confirm the selected count and type before one atomic permanent-deletion save. Reject changed/expired selections, preserve unselected/new records, and keep all selected items on write failure.
- Keep mandatory manual Start/Teleport confirmation for widgets. This batch is development work; the official 2.5.7 release and its IPA are unchanged.
- Validation-only Mac run 40222489196 passed 474 tests and compiled the app/widget extension with Xcode 27.1. IPA packaging/upload was skipped. Reset/authentication/icon behavior still needs physical-iPhone acceptance; exact source and checks are recorded in the Change Ledger.

## 2.5.7 (56) — official release — 25 October 2026

- Add configurable Location shortcut widgets: choose a different saved place or route start for each small/medium widget. Tapping only prepares a preview pin, including while another spoofing session is active. Users must manually tap Teleport/Start in Shift; widget links cannot start, stop or move a session. Keep existing Favorite/Saved shortcuts compatible and remove their unnecessary timed refreshes.
- Show existing named areas as gray outlines and labels while drawing/editing. Reject new or reshaped overlapping interiors with the conflicting area's name; shared edges/corners and multiple separate areas with the same name are allowed. Enforce the same rule for imports/restores while preserving readable legacy geometry and harmless renames.
- Rename the review heading to Settings & Library Import Overview (or the matching single-content heading). Count new library items and changed settings compared with current device data, independent of checkboxes. Put changed settings before identical values.
- Simplify Import & export: Everything is the export default, followed by Settings and Saved routes & areas (including saved places). Remove the long input explanation, LiveContainer-specific settings help and redundant Other files footer. Add a small json.site link beside Paste instructions.
- Allow file/Paste analysis and review during a session, and allow library-only imports while spoofing. Applying selected changed settings still requires a stopped session because those settings can alter movement and session controls.
- First official distribution of builds 54–55's backup recovery work: file-data picker, native Paste, 32 MiB validation, cancel/late-result protection, per-item review, all 25 portable settings with current/imported values, separate/combined exports, duplicate prevention and selected-subset capacity checks. Include the separate JSON fixtures, combined test file and exact-value checklist.
- Add regressions for overview ordering/counts, session gates, area containment/crossings/boundary contact/date-line geometry, configurable widget selection, deleted targets and the manual-start rule. Mac run 40215371297 passed 455 tests and compiled both targets with Xcode 27.1 in 5m 14s. Downloaded IPA integrity, stable 2.5.7 (56) metadata and the matching Actions checksum were verified; exact source and package evidence are in the Change Ledger. Physical-iPhone acceptance remains a device check.

## 2.5.6 (55) — test build — 25 October 2026

- Rename the backup destination to Import & export. One file/Paste entry point detects settings-only, library-only and combined backups, then opens a dedicated review screen before saving anything.
- Review all 25 supported settings individually with current/imported values; settings start unchecked and identical values are labeled Already the same. Each selected setting merges into current preferences, preserving every unchecked field and internal MPH speed storage.
- Select routes, saved places and named areas independently, including individual items and select-all/none controls. Existing identities keep local edits and cannot be imported twice. Capacity applies only to the selected subset; confirmation is rejected if the current library/settings changed since its preview.
- Export Settings only, Routes/places/areas, or Everything. Keep the existing Shift/Locus v1/v2 formats, file/Paste reader protections and LiveContainer Fix File Picker guidance.
- Add separate settings and routes/areas sample JSONs, a detailed expected-values checklist and selection/legacy/capacity regressions. The library sample includes two drawn routes, two saved places, two named areas and 15/90/30/7200-second stops.
- Requested test build 55 uses the prerelease channel and an Actions artifact. Official v2.5.4/main remain unchanged; no new GitHub release is published. Run 40211268590 passed 442 tests, native app/extension compilation and IPA inspection (3m 31s). The downloaded checksum matches the GitHub artifact; the Change Ledger records source and package evidence. Signed iPhone/LiveContainer acceptance remains pending.

## 2.5.5 (54) — test build — 25 October 2026

- Requested device-test IPA for the backup import changes developed on 24 October. Set both targets to 2.5.5 (54) and the app channel to prerelease; distribute as an Actions artifact, with official v2.5.4 unchanged. Add a small sample JSON with two test places, one drawn route and 15/90-second stops; full settings are included after the maintainer requested a detailed import check.
- Add a native Paste action in Files & backups for complete backup JSON, avoiding the hosted file picker. Both text and file input use the existing validated Shift/Locus backup format and require the same preview/category selection/confirmation before merging. Existing routes, geometry, waits and local edits are preserved; settings remain opt-in.
- Replace JSON-only SwiftUI file selection with an import-as-copy UIKit picker accepting file data. Keep presentation on the persistent screen, ignore obsolete/duplicate callbacks, and never turn controller teardown into cancellation. Explain early picker dismissal.
- Coordinate file-provider reads, hold temporary access through the read, enforce the 32 MiB cap during reading and before text copying, and check/decode on a worker. Reject folders, links, unrelated/truncated JSON and invalid backup contents. Cancel/failure leaves an existing valid preview intact; canceled late results cannot replace it.
- Add visible LiveContainer guidance: long-press Shift → Settings → Fix File Picker, then relaunch. If that does not help, use Paste backup text. Add backup recovery instructions and regression coverage.
- Add a validation-only workflow mode (default): run tests and compile the native app/extension without packaging or uploading an IPA. Explicitly enable packaging for a requested build. The initial validation run created no IPA. Packaging is now explicitly requested for build 54; no GitHub release is published.

- Earlier source validation: Mac run 40167635354 passed 430 tests and compiled the app/extension with Xcode 27.1 (4m 56s total). IPA packaging/upload were skipped; no artifact or release was created. Exact tested commit, existing warnings and remaining iPhone/LiveContainer checks are recorded in the Shift Change Ledger.

- Build 54 passed 431 Mac tests, app/extension compilation and IPA inspection in run 40208929771 (2m 36s). Both targets are 2.5.5 (54) with prerelease channel. The revised full-settings sample passed all 11 backup-reader tests locally after the build; only sample/test/docs changed. See the Change Ledger for tested source, matching artifact checksum and remaining device checks.

## 2.5.4 (53) — official — 24 October 2026

- Promote the tested 2.5.4 feature set to official release `v2.5.4`. This includes the 2.5.x route preview and controls, 0–24-hour waits, mph/km/h, independent install identity, cloud Life360/Find My status, and daily official-update notice described below.
- Set the app's embedded update channel to `stable` and increment both app and extension to build 53. Beta build 52 can discover this official version; stable installs do not offer themselves again. No feature logic changed from build 52.
- Update the public README, source map and release instructions for official distribution. Small fixes will be collected on the development branch; prerelease IPA builds/publication are no longer automatic for each fix.
- Official validation: run 40153593002 passed all 420 tests and built the app/extension with Xcode 27.1 in 2m 51s (job 2m 47s). The downloaded IPA passed ZIP/digest checks; both targets are 2.5.4 (53), and the app embeds the stable channel. Exact source, checksum and distribution evidence are in the Shift Change Ledger. Device/provider acceptance limits still apply.

## 2.5.4 (52) — prerelease — 24 October 2026

- Check the repository's latest official GitHub release when Shift becomes active or Settings opens, at most once every rolling 24 hours. Persist the attempt before networking, including offline/failure/cancellation, so reopening never creates a retry loop. No timer, background task, push subscription or automatic IPA download is added.
- Show a small native card at the top of Settings only for a newer official version. More info opens that exact release on GitHub; X remembers dismissal for that tag across launches. A later official version can show a new notice. Release details remain under About Shift → Software updates.
- Exclude drafts, prereleases, unpublished releases and nonnumeric/prerelease tags; compare version components numerically and reject links outside this repository's exact release page. Explicit build-channel metadata also permits a beta to discover the same version's later official release.
- Use an anonymous HTTPS request with a short timeout, conditional ETag responses, one request in flight, no cookies or credentials, and persisted rate-limit delays. Keep errors quiet and never report "up to date" on failure. Cached notices expire after seven days without a successful check.
- Add regression tests for daily/relaunch limits, concurrency, cancellation, conditional responses, offline/rate-limit failures, dismissal, stable/beta version rules, unsafe links, removed releases, malformed data, stale cache and Settings search.
- Update source ownership, release instructions and the Shift Change Ledger. Validation: 420 tests passed (325 Swift, 14 packaging/icon, 19 Windows, 62 cloud); Xcode 27.1 built the app and extension and packaged the IPA. Run 40152801782 completed in 2m 51s (build job 2m 45s). Download integrity, app/extension 2.5.4 build 52 and prerelease channel verified. Prerelease `v2.5.4-beta.1`; physical-iPhone layout, VoiceOver and energy measurement remain pending.

## 2.5.3 (51) — prerelease — 23 October 2026

- Add optional Life360 support to the Render helper: protected observer sign-in, Circle/profile selection, read-only requests and disconnect. Apple and Life360 have independent sign-in, polling, errors and freshness. Either can be used alone.
- Extend the existing Shift Live Activity with separate Find My iPhone and Life360 status/age rows and compact icons. One activity, no duplicate checker. Expanded Island uses one compact status/age row per service and shows the command timer once. Each visibility switch hides only its status, without stopping checks. Display choices persist and are included in library settings backups.
- Add per-service cloud checking switches (Life360 defaults off). Older pairings/helpers remain compatible; outdated helpers explain the Life360 upgrade. Windows Life360 reports can also appear in the same activity.
- Distinguish offline, server wake/timeout, bad address, certificate failure, wrong key, replaced session, rate limit, invalid clock/request and unsupported responses. Connection tests show each provider's readiness without fetching locations.
- Add a shareable /healthz URL and free cron-job.org guidance. Health pings never poll providers, extend the phone lease or prove a match. No paid hosting or push service was added.
- Add twelve cloud and six Swift regression tests covering isolation, protected setup, actual report age, stop/lease handling, backward compatibility, local evidence and activity payload size. Refresh the bundled source-only helper.
- Update the Change Ledger, source map, setup and device checklist. Battery proposals remain separate and await user approval; none are implemented here.
- Validation: both build-51 attempts passed 402 tests (307 Swift, 14 packaging/icon, 19 Windows, 62 cloud). Final Mac run 40066390461 built the app and extension and packaged the IPA in 2m 33s. Exact commits, checksums and layout follow-up are in the Change Ledger. Prerelease `v2.5.3-beta.1`; real provider sign-in and physical-iPhone acceptance remain pending.

## 2.5.2 (50) — prerelease — 23 October 2026

- Replace raw stop-seconds entry with labeled Hours / Minutes / Seconds wheels. Every whole second from no wait to 24 hours is selectable; 24 hours resets the smaller units to zero. Large accessibility text uses labeled menus.
- Offer No wait, 15 sec, 1 min, 5 min, 1 hr and 24 hr shortcuts. Keep Cancel/Done and explicit Apply to all stops. The shared editor appears in the timeline, Edit place and Add stop screens.
- Remove the old one-hour cap from route planning, path stops, live stop insertion, saved-trip validation and backup imports. Existing durations keep their meaning; older builds may reject backups with waits over one hour.
- Display hours/minutes/seconds in route wait totals, rehearsal countdowns and active-stop countdowns. Totals can exceed 24 hours across multiple stops.
- Add regression coverage for all 86,401 selectable durations, component edits, 24-hour countdown/recovery, preview waits, save/backup round trips and invalid inputs. Pauses and suspension still do not silently consume a wait.
- Add a maintained Change Ledger, app source map, verification/setup recommendations and device checklist. Document that Find My Devices reaches Dynamic Island; Life360 currently stays in the in-app Windows-helper reports. No new monitoring service or verification guarantee is introduced.
- Validated by Mac run 40052908812: 384 tests passed, app and Live Activity extension built, and packaged IPA checks passed. Prerelease tag: `v2.5.2-beta.1`. The new controls and a full-day session still need physical-iPhone acceptance testing.

## 2.5.1 (49) — test build — 23 October 2026

- Keep active route controls compact: target speed, distance, progress, Pause/Resume and Stop spoofing. Route details, movement tools and End route remain in the menu; connection warnings and stop countdowns stay visible.
- Show starts, stops and destinations in a numbered route timeline. Open wait editing only when needed and keep optional movement settings collapsed.
- Add 0/5/15/30/60-second stop presets and an explicit Apply to all stops action. Cancel leaves the draft unchanged.
- Scrub the isolated route preview or jump directly to a stop; seeking pauses the preview and restores waits when moving backwards.
- Defer icon preference updates until iOS returns the app to the active state, keep selection feedback local, and preserve the selected tab across scene restoration. Physical-device confirmation of the reported flicker is still required.
- Build 49 was built twice successfully: the 09:21 PDT attempt, then the delivered 09:24 PDT attempt after correcting preview accessibility text, route-reordering help and saved-path section guidance. Both runs and their exact commits are recorded in the Change Ledger.

## 2.5.0 (48) — test build — 22 October 2026

- Enter route-stop waits in seconds (0–3,600), including stops under a minute.
- Choose mph or km/h throughout planning, movement controls, saved trips and history. Conversion uses exact factors; stored trip speeds keep full precision and remain backward compatible.
- Give Shift an independent app/extension bundle ID and app group, and stop claiming Locus's URL scheme. See [migration notes](docs/TESTING-2.5.md) before installing.
- Open session details from notification taps, suppress duplicate foreground connection banners, and offer connection details from session alerts.
- Validate pairing candidates with the engine decoder before replacing the installed file.
- Default detailed logging to off on fresh installs and scale the About title with Dynamic Type.
- Add Find a place and Create a route actions to empty Library categories.


The recorded evolution from the original Locus snapshot to **Shift 2.4.4 (47)**.
This history was reconstructed from saved source archives and update notes,
including changes made between Git pushes. These are this fork’s milestones,
not upstream Locus release numbers. Some builds were internal or diagnostic;
not every version was publicly released. Dates are omitted where no reliable
release record exists. Related edits made under the same version are grouped.

Historical entries describe what changed **then**. They do not mean removed
features—such as tutorials, app-specific Battery Saver or the notification
preview—are present now. Current features are in the [README](README.md).

## What changed from the starting app

| Area | Shift’s cumulative additions and revisions |
| --- | --- |
| Identity & interface | Shift / N3mo Studio branding; Map, Library and Settings; Glacier, Afterhours and Porcelain; nine independent icons |
| Movement | Preview-first teleport, refined joystick, directions and route alternatives, drawing/editing, stops, waits, per-section speeds and route jumps |
| Library | Named places/areas, folders/search, saved trips, duplication, three-version edit history, Recently Deleted and export/import |
| Status | Timestamped command evidence, unverified/stale states, Live Activities, Dynamic Island, widgets and recovery |
| Optional checks | Self-hosted cloud/Windows helpers, Find My Devices comparisons, readiness tests and configurable Shift connection checks |
| Privacy & efficiency | Device-authentication lock, display privacy, reviewed local exports, bounded logs, quieter timers and comparable reliability runs |

## 2.4.4 · build 47 — Public build follow-up · 15 October 2026

- Fixed the final IPA appearance check to accept Xcode asset-catalog icon declarations while still checking the expected icon names. Portable system-size PNG validation remains in place.
- Corrected the default app icon's dark/tinted filename capitalization and added exact-name source checks so Windows cannot hide a mismatch from the build runner.
- Added 12 packaging regression tests to GitHub Actions. The local regression suite passed; earlier build logs recorded 279 Swift model tests and 69 helper tests passing.
- Confirmed a successful GitHub Actions build after the validation fix. The maintainer reported that the IPA installs and works on their iPhone; this is a device smoke check, not verification of every feature or supported configuration.
- Configured direct IPA artifact downloads and automatic filenames from the built app version, currently `Shift 2.4.4.ipa`, without an outer artifact ZIP.

## Public repository preparation · 14 October 2026

- Refreshed the README and brand presentation; consolidated private hand-off notes into this history and current guides.
- Added current release copy, upload instructions, contribution/issue templates and explicit MIT attribution for Shift alongside upstream notices.
- Retained the verified 2.4.4 runtime source. Removed personal compiler paths from the public IPA copy, preserving executable/data sections and entitlements, and recomputed its ad-hoc signature hashes. Packaging is not a new feature build or on-device validation.

## 2.4.4 · build 47 — Native notifications

- Removed the test-banner settings section, preview scheduler and preview messages introduced in 2.4.3.
- Retained native alternate-icon selection and existing pairing, reminder and connection notifications. No extra timer, polling or background activity was added.
- Preserved the 2.4.1 launch fix, native tab navigation, all icon choices, helper protocols and app identities. An iOS-cached notification icon is not claimed to be fixed.

## 2.4.3 · build 46 — Temporary notification preview — superseded

- Added a one-shot Send Test Banner action to App Icon settings, with permission/error handling and a five-second trigger.
- Used an ordinary system notification to inspect the current icon; it did not override the banner icon or clear iOS caches.
- This feature was removed in 2.4.4 and is not part of the current interface.

## 2.4.2 · build 45 — Native glass navigation and complete icon sizes

- Moved Map, Library and Settings to the current native Tab API with filled symbols and the selected style’s accent. Kept the bar expanded during map navigation and intentionally hidden in drawing editors.
- Renamed the map-panel switch to Liquid Glass Map Controls; system navigation remains governed by iOS appearance and accessibility.
- Corrected portable-build linked-SDK metadata to the actual iOS 27.1 SDK instead of the iOS 18 deployment target.
- Bundled notification/settings/search/Home Screen sizes for all nine portable icon choices and added a package validator for icon resources and linked SDK metadata.
- Kept regular notification badges system-controlled; the Live Activity’s own mark follows the selected icon design.

## 2.4.1 · build 44 — First-launch crash repair

- Fixed an appearance-anchor exception caused by reading a custom trait override before one existed. The anchor now reads the resolved trait collection before updating overrides.
- Removed the diagnostic launch screen/handlers. Preserved appearance choices, app data and bundle IDs.

## 2.4.0 · diagnostic builds 42–43 — Launch investigation

- Temporary launch-check builds recorded startup stages and captured the appearance-trait exception after the main screen opened.
- These were diagnostic iterations of 2.4.0, not separate feature releases. Their launch gate is absent from the normal 2.4.1+ builds.

## 2.4.0 · build 41 — Three styles, nine icons

- Added Glacier (ice blue/silver), Afterhours (ink/violet) and Porcelain (chalk/graphite), each with light/dark palettes, setup treatment, control shapes, settings surfaces and widget/activity colors.
- Added Default, Dark and Tinted icon choices for each family, independent of interface style. Saved selection only after iOS confirmed the icon change.
- Included native appearance asset catalogs and portable manual icon choices. Appearance changes add no network, location or polling work.
- This initial appearance build had a first-launch crash, repaired in 2.4.1; do not use it in preference to the current release.

## 2.3.2 · build 40 — Stable area drafts and simpler helpers

- Moved named-area presentation out of reusable list sections, retained one draft identity/camera/corner list, and separated it from recurring session-status updates. Added discard confirmation.
- Added a 3–15 second Connection checks setting (default 10) for held-session evidence and Live Activity freshness. Route/joystick movement and Apple helper polling remain separate.
- Unified Find My checks around Cloud helper and Windows helper. Added direct Render URL/key connection, compatible setup-file import and an authenticated readiness test that does not start monitoring.
- Added Windows local-address detection and protected persistent pairing identity. Restarts on the same address retain pairing; changed addresses or renewed credentials require re-import.
- Added Windows session evidence to Live Activities, one-active-helper selection and specific connection errors.
- Changed generated pairing/export/helper branding to Shift while retaining legacy imports, storage IDs and deep links.
- Prepared reusable public source without a built-in personal Render URL, helper key, account or deployed service.

## 2.3.1 · build 39 — Touch capture, map-relative joystick and quieter idle work

- Moved route/area input onto a fixed surface above MapKit so taps and freehand input do not compete with native map recognizers. Coordinated second-finger cancellation, pan, pinch and parent scrolling.
- Made joystick movement follow the visible map heading on each tick, using the fixed pad rather than the moving thumb as its coordinate space.
- Reduced initial setup to a Wi-Fi / LocalDevVPN / pairing checklist with one readiness-driven primary action and expandable pairing options.
- In a follow-up under the same version, limited idle foreground location demand to visible map use and made the device-origin picker one bounded, cancellable request.
- Added eight saved battery/reliability results and two-run comparisons with foreground/away time, Low Power Mode, charging, interruption and configuration context. Observes battery notifications only during a test; does not claim app-only energy measurement.

## 2.3.0 · build 38 — Map, library and setup redesign

- Introduced the Map / Library / Settings navigation structure, refreshed setup/settings/editor surfaces, and a new default/dark/tinted icon direction.
- Reworked map drawing navigation to address vertical drift and parent-sheet scrolling during two-finger pan/zoom, including projection and anchoring checks.
- Expanded accessible point editing and directional movement controls, with reduced-motion/transparency support.
- Restyled helper pages and setup directions while preserving existing URLs, authentication and setup-file formats. Follow-up input corrections shipped in 2.3.1.

## 2.2.6 · build 37 — Paused routes and buffered logs

- Changed paused-route work from frequent wake-ups to control/connection signals. Resume, seek and cancellation wake it; paused time is not added to the next movement step.
- Grouped routine command and activity log writes into 32 KiB batches or five-second flushes. Failures, user actions, exports and lifecycle changes flush promptly.
- Kept held-location refresh and clear-command ordering. A sudden exit can lose the last buffered routine log entries; battery savings were not measured.

## 2.2.5 · build 36 — Less unnecessary background work

- Shared the session monitor with remote Find My, reused its network session, and added bounded failure backoff with manual retry.
- Let the held-location monitor sleep until relevant deadlines; stopped movement timers for an untouched joystick.
- Paused status timers and automatic camera following where their views are inactive or hidden. Skipped unchanged Live Activity evidence and helper-only recovery writes.
- Preserved location-command timing, evidence expiry and helper credentials. No fixed battery-saving percentage was claimed.

## 2.2.4 · build 35 — Find My freshness and activity evidence

- Displayed remote Find My evidence separately from successful spoofing commands in Live Activities and Dynamic Island; distinguished Apple report age from helper reply age.
- Corrected a helper cache path that returned before a due refresh. Concurrent checks share one refresh and wait briefly for a fresh snapshot without duplicate Apple requests.
- Preserved Apple timestamps, freshness limits and rate limiting. Old reports remain old; the change cannot force Apple to update.

## 2.2.3 · build 34 — Render browser setup

- Added private browser-based helper setup: unlock, Apple sign-in/verification, choose a device, download pairing and reconnect from the phone.
- Added HTTPS Render pairing alongside the existing pinned-certificate and Windows formats, plus a public health endpoint without private data.
- Stable helper keys preserve phone pairing across server restarts; the Apple login must be renewed. Health pings do not extend an inactive monitoring session.

## 2.2.2 · build 33 — Native recognizer attachment repair

- Corrected two map gesture attachment sites to use the supported native recognizer modifier instead of SwiftUI simultaneousGesture.
- Preserved callbacks, coordinate conversions, simultaneous map navigation and the smaller view components from 2.2.1.

## 2.2.1 · build 32 — Map expression build repair

- Split the oversized map expression into smaller content, gesture and overlay functions after a Swift type-check timeout.
- Kept pin adjustment, magnifier, saved-place appearance, search and duplication behavior. A further native modifier correction followed in 2.2.2.

## 2.2.0 · build 31 — Precise pins and personal places

- Added hold-and-drag pin adjustment with a magnifier; release remains a preview until Teleport is tapped.
- Added saved-place names, ten icons and six colors, preserving them through backups and Recently Deleted.
- Added local Settings search with everyday aliases and visible trip duplication actions. Copies retain route settings and do not start movement.

## 2.1.5 · build 30 — Map input and route-planner cleanup

- Captured map touches at first contact in map coordinates and removed pin insertion animation; restricted route-hold recognition to existing routes.
- Grouped route endpoints, compacted mode/speed controls, and reorganized optional stops, arrival and movement settings.
- Smoothed drawing presentation and batched coalesced touch samples with a stable overlay and cached distance, reducing repeated work.

## 2.1.4 · build 29 — Glass settings

- Added grouped glass settings surfaces, featured Appearance/Live Activities choices, clearer icons and full-width rows.
- Added accessible large-text layouts and solid contrast/transparency fallbacks. Kept all settings destinations and existing engine behavior.

## 2.1.3 · build 28 — Settings build fixes

- Corrected the Experimental Features section declaration and moved battery conversion into the session-test model after Battery Saver removal.
- Added battery-reading validation tests; retained the simplified settings from 2.1.2.

## 2.1.2 · build 27 — Calmer settings

- Shortened rows and repeated explanations; moved experimental service checks and reliability tools into their own area.
- Reduced helper setup to small steps with direct import for existing setup files. Kept export/privacy warnings and current errors visible.

## 2.1.1 · build 26 — Removed the app-specific Battery Saver

- Removed the separate Shift Battery Saver, exception controls, confirmation prompts and activity battery cutoff.
- Returned glass and Live Activities to their own switches. iPhone Low Power Mode and accessibility remain system controls.
- Kept old backups compatible while ignoring retired Saver fields and removing the retired shortcut.

## 2.1.0 · build 25 — Remote Find My prototype

- Added opt-in cloud helper checks during active sessions, timestamp-based report comparisons and expiring match evidence.
- Added helper/sign-in/mismatch warnings and a no-recent-confirmation reminder, without claiming force-close detection.
- Introduced bounded server-memory monitoring leases and scoped device helper-key storage. No Find My People integration or independent push service.

## 2.0.1 · build 24 — Simpler setup and helper onboarding

- Refreshed first-use cards, shortened connection instructions and tucked optional import controls away.
- Moved timeline/problem markers into Export or import; added dedicated Windows helper setup and shareable helper downloads.
- Clarified recovery requirements, compacted joystick/naming controls, and added Battery Saver exceptions that were later removed in 2.1.1.

## 2.0.0 · build 23 — Locus becomes Shift

- Introduced Shift by N3mo Studio, the original ribbon mark, sea-glass/ink palette and a full-screen map with capsule search and a glass dock.
- Redesigned the planner, saved library, search, setup, settings, editors, widgets and Live Activities while keeping explicit preview/start controls.
- Added bundled source credits and license notices with packaging checks.
- Preserved the Locus app/group/storage identities, pairing and library formats for in-place upgrades. The original engine was not replaced.

## 1.12.0 · build 22 — Timeline, saved search and edit history

- Added a local session timeline and explicit problem markers tied to the developer log, without automatic uploads.
- Added saved place/trip name search alongside Apple results.
- Kept up to three distinct earlier saved-trip versions with preview, restore/undo, stale-edit protection and atomic persistence. Current-trip export excludes historical versions.

## 1.11.1 · build 21 — Alert logging build fix

- Added the missing alert-helper overload used by trip rename, preserving popup behavior and presentation logging.

## 1.11.0 · build 20 — Recovery and developer logs

- Clarified unfinished-session recovery and failed clear operations instead of reporting success without evidence.
- Improved continuous hold-to-drag route marker interaction and coordinate alignment.
- Added a local, exportable 48-hour developer log with bounded storage, explicit event markers, credential exclusions and honest gaps after suspension/termination.

## 1.10.0 · build 19 — Editing, widgets and optional computer checks

- Added explicit Map / Draw / Pan tools, a below-finger drawing cursor, and point/corner editing with insertion, movement, deletion and undo/redo.
- Added 30-day Recently Deleted for saved places, trips and areas, with safe persistence and restore behavior.
- Added Home Screen shortcuts/widgets, connection details and optional iPhone readback evidence.
- Added the Windows Find My Devices/Life360 helper prototype and compatible backup settings.
- Added an app-specific Battery Saver; it was subsequently removed in Shift 2.1.1.

## 1.9.1 · build 18 — Removed tutorials and simplified drawing

- Removed tutorials, quizzes and tutorial menus while retaining connection setup.
- Kept Export or import at the bottom of Settings; made the compact map panel default to clear glass without resizing the map.
- Simplified tap/freehand drawing and two-finger navigation, and changed new-install location-name privacy defaults. The explicit Pan tool returned in 1.10.0.

## 1.9.0 · build 17 — Named areas and better library organization

- Treated VPN-interface detection as a hint rather than a connection gate; setup checks the actual developer connection.
- Added named areas with polygon containment/overlap rules, persistent place names, rename controls and labels throughout routes and activities.
- Added route place/stop names and waits, selective export/import for places/areas, trips and settings, and compatibility with 1.8 backups.
- Refined panel collapse and app-switcher privacy explanations. An intermediate build correction was issued under the same version.

## 1.8.0 · build 16 — Recovery, reliability and library backups

- Added recoverable trip checkpoints and explicit Resume; reopening alone never starts travel.
- Added a session reliability test, arrival choices, configurable panel shortcuts, folders and saved-library search.
- Added duplicate-and-edit trips and previewed library backup import/merge, excluding pairing, app-lock and other private connection state.

## 1.7.0 · build 15 — Preview-first journeys and compact controls

- Separated Show route from Start route, isolated planner drafts from running sessions, and introduced per-mode usual-speed presets.
- Added future stops during playback, improved route-jump selection and changed Undo jump to ten seconds.
- Refined activity wording, compact controls and temporary place naming; added an activity battery cutoff that was later removed.
- Added optional tutorials and settings grouping. Tutorials were removed in 1.9.1.

## 1.6.0 · build 14 — Setup, practice and privacy tools

- Added guided Wi-Fi/tunnel/pairing/connection verification with cancellation and expiring setup evidence.
- Added per-section route modes, draggable stops/endpoint editing and route practice without location commands.
- Added optional device-authentication app lock, app-switcher protection and recent-location retention controls.
- Added explicit, previewed problem-report sharing with an allowlisted set of diagnostic fields.

## 1.5.3 · build 13 — Touch targets and readable places

- Removed irrelevant idle speed controls and expanded button hit areas.
- Changed smooth movement’s default to off, retaining later explicit choices and per-trip settings.
- Added temporary session/place labels governed by activity privacy choices and optional clear glass controls.
- Clarified the distinction between an airplane-mode/network change, an active developer connection and successfully clearing a simulated location.

## 1.5.2 · builds 11–12 — Precise map coordinates and route timing

- Changed search teleport selection to pin preview before an explicit location command.
- Unified touch/map coordinate spaces, refined freehand sampling and route-marker snapping, and used flat map geometry.
- Made route pacing account for command duration while bounding catch-up after long execution gaps.
- Added honest device-origin selection without treating a simulated fix as fresh physical GPS, plus separate activity-surface privacy/progress preferences.
- Included a compiler correction in build 12 under the same version.

## 1.5.1 · build 10 — Stable viewport and cancellable actions

- Kept the map viewport fixed under an overlay tray and removed competing whole-map gestures.
- Improved route-marker hit targets, explicit Teleport/Plan search choices and cancellation of stale search results.
- Preserved paused route state during retry, queued explicit teleport behind in-flight writes and reduced redundant state/geometry updates.

## 1.5.0 · build 9 — Saved trips and stops

- Added saved trips with atomic persistence, rename/delete and full route/settings restoration into a preview.
- Added stops and waiting times, route pauses, reorder controls and continued wait-state handling.
- Added optional gradual acceleration/braking/turn slowing and Undo jump with stop-history restoration.
- Changed status wording to distinguish the last accepted command from independent proof of another app’s location.

## 1.4.0 — Flexible movement and route drawing

- Added explicit walking-path fallback/preference for cycling, live mode/speed changes and confirmed reroute choices.
- Added per-mode saved speed controls, a collapsible map panel and route-jump preview/confirmation.
- Added tap-point/freehand/pan drawing with bounded undo/redo and explicit review before movement.

## 1.3.1 — Simpler route and joystick controls

- Restricted joystick opening to an established session and separated Pause, Continue, End route and Stop spoofing.
- Added a fixed Start route action, isolated search/planner drafts from teleport pins, and prevented cancelled/late route writes from resuming travel.

## 1.3.0 — Directions and live journeys

- Added editable route endpoints, available route alternatives, source/distance/advisory information and separate simulation-time estimates.
- Added confirmed progress, pause/resume, map following/recenter/overview and journey details in Live Activities.

## 1.2.0 — Cycling and e-bike controls

- Added cycling/e-bike routing requests and persisted e-bike speeds for routes and joystick.
- Added route provenance and estimated travel time, with stale route-request rejection and explicit coverage/error handling.

## 1.1.0 — First custom session experience

- Introduced the custom map/session panel, appearance choices, accessible labeled controls and local Live Activity/WidgetKit extension.
- Added Lock Screen/Dynamic Island privacy, reminders and deduplicated warnings with timestamped command evidence and expiry.
- Serialized connection work, guarded cancellation/late completions, and made Stop wait for in-flight writes without inventing successful cleanup.
- Added honest relaunch/unverified states and Low Power Mode presentation adjustments. An early compiler correction was incorporated into the saved source.

## Starting point — upstream Locus

The first custom archive records
[`ChrisMack32/Locus@83c8fb324983728e8f44759cfd834dc637ee38b5`](https://github.com/ChrisMack32/Locus/tree/83c8fb324983728e8f44759cfd834dc637ee38b5)
as its base. Locus and the idevice engine provided the underlying application,
pairing and location-simulation foundation. Their copyright/license notices
remain intact. This changelog does not claim those foundations were created by
N3mo Studio or invent a release number for that starting snapshot.

The original binary dependency remains bundled; no new vendor-engine rewrite
is part of this history. See [credits and scope](NOTICE.md).
